<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
Based on <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324">IETF RFC 2324</a> and its update, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7168">IETF RFC 7168</a>, this resource allows for the fullfillment of a device request for an artfully brewed caffeinated beverage, 
but coffee shares this quality with many other varied preparations based on the filtration of plant material.  Foremost, among these are the category of brews 
based on the straining of water through prepared leaves from a tea tree.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
This resource may relate to NutritionOrder with the variance that the subject may be Patient, Practitioner or, possibly, RelatedPerson if that individual is not responding to conventional awakening therapy.  
</p><p>
This also has a need for a sub-class of Device to allow for coffeepot, teapot and, potentially additional classes of espresso machine and cappacino machine with associated responses.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
IETF RFC 2324 and 7168 outline the creation of the HTCPCP which uses a modified header for the BREW/POST and message/[coffee/tea]pot mimetypes.</p>
<p>FHIR uses only the standard http protocols which will limit the ability for appropriate caffeination of Person(s) as needed.  As such, it was felt that taking thise Pre-FHIR RFCs and 
create a resource that can take the header information from a HTCPCP request and transform it into a FHIR appropriate request to a Device with full use of the http status codes needed for processing</p>
